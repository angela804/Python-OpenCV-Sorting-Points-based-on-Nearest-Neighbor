# Python-OpenCV-Sorting-Points-based-on-Nearest-Neighbor

In OpenCV, points are sorted based on the column and then rows. The goal is to sort the array such that it is sorted in a way that it forms a continuous line.
The code assumes that you have two arrays, one from the x-coordinates, and one from the y-coordinates.

OpenCV stores the coordinates in this way: https://github.com/angela804/Python-OpenCV-Sorting-Points-based-on-Nearest-Neighbor/blob/main/opencv.png

So we want it sorted by the nearest neighbor to form a continuous line.
